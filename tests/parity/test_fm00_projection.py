"""The full-to-reduced projection, and the rank it depends on.

The converter's one numerically dangerous step. It can be wrong while looking
entirely plausible: a reduced basis short of a direction still produces a
projection, still returns weights of the right shape, and still runs. What it
does not do is compute the same function.

So the projection is pinned three ways. Its residual is measured, never
assumed. Its rank is checked against a derivation that uses no coupling
coefficients at all. And it is applied to a real trained model's weights and
compared on what the contraction computes, never on the weights themselves.
