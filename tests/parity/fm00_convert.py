"""Reading a trained legacy block's weights into the rewrite's canonical layout.

The frozen tree stores an equivariant linear as e3nn does, and the rewrite
stores it differently. Both hold the same map; what differs is the order the
numbers are written in and where a normalization is applied.

Two differences, both measured against a trained anchor rather than read off
documentation:

**Order.** e3nn walks its instructions input-term major and lays each one out as
a ``[multiplicity_in, multiplicity_out]`` block. The rewrite enumerates output
copies major and input copies minor, over copies rather than terms. The map
between them is a transpose of each block followed by a re-walk.

**Normalization.** e3nn keeps the raw weight and multiplies by a per-instruction
factor inside the forward, ``1 / sqrt(fan_in)`` where the fan-in is the total
input multiplicity reaching that output irrep. Measured on the anchor: 1/sqrt(16)
where one term feeds an output, 1/sqrt(32) where two do and 1/sqrt(48) where
three do. The rewrite's linear has no hidden factor, so the conversion **folds
it into the weights**. That is the right side to put it on: an op with a silent
scale is an op whose stored weights do not mean what they say.
