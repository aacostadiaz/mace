"""Fixtures for the in-process legacy-vs-v1 comparisons.

`tests/parity/` is one of the two places allowed to import both stacks, which
is what makes the frozen tree a live oracle rather than a folder of JSON.

Running the two in one process is only valid if the first leaves nothing
behind. Every test here that touches the frozen tree runs inside `isolated`,
which snapshots the process's globals and puts them back, and
`test_process_state.py` asserts that it does rather than trusting it.
