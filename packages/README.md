# The MACE v1 packages

Three packages, one direction of dependency:

```
mace-core            contract + pure math; no torch, no jax, no e3nn
   ^        ^
   |        |
mace-torch  mace-jax
```

`mace_torch` and `mace_jax` are two implementations of one contract. Neither
imports the other, and neither imports the legacy `mace` package, which stays
in the tree as a frozen numerical oracle until it is retired.

`mace_core` holds what both frameworks agree on: the configuration schema, the
data layer, the declared observables, the Clebsch-Gordan basis, the kernel and
solver contracts, and the metadata a model carries. `mace_torch` is the full
implementation: models, training, deployment. `mace_jax` is inference only and
is still empty. [Navigating the tree](#navigating-the-tree) says what is in
every file.

## Names

| Directory | Distribution | Import name | Tag prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/mace-core` | `mace-core` | `mace_core` | `mace-core-v*` |
| `packages/mace-torch` | `mace-torch-v1` | `mace_torch` | `mace-torch-v*` |
| `packages/mace-jax` | `mace-jax` | `mace_jax` | `mace-jax-v*` |
| `packages/mace-launcher` | `mace-launcher` | `mace_launcher` | `mace-launcher-v*` |

The import names never collide with the legacy import name `mace`, so both
stacks live in one process.

The distribution names cannot all match their import names. The legacy package
holds the `mace-torch` distribution name, and two distributions cannot both
hold one name in a single environment, so the v1 PyTorch package ships as
**`mace-torch-v1`** while keeping the `mace_torch` import name.

**`mace-torch-v1` is never published to PyPI.** It exists so the two stacks can
be installed side by side while both are in the tree. `mace-torch` on PyPI is
frozen at its final v0.3.x release and stays dormant for the whole rewrite, so
the name is free the moment legacy leaves the tree: RET-6 renames the
distribution to `mace-torch`, and the v1.0.0 release publishes under that name.
PyPI has no rename operation, so publishing `mace-torch-v1` even once would
turn that switch from a no-op into a permanent user migration.

Tag prefixes are keyed on the directory rather than the distribution name, so
each package versions independently from git tags and the RET-6 rename touches
only the `name` field.

`mace-launcher` owns every `mace_*` console script and none of the other three
declares one, because two distributions declaring the same script name is
undefined behaviour in pip. That is not a theoretical hazard: uninstalling one
of two such distributions deletes the script files the other one had
overwritten, and the surviving distribution is left with none.

The rule is one owner per script name, not one owner overall. `mace-jax` will
declare a single script of its own, `mace-jax`, when its CLI lands: it does not
depend on `mace-torch` and has to work with no torch installed, so it cannot
inherit a script from either the launcher or `mace-torch`. The hyphen keeps the
name outside the `mace_*` set, so the two owners never overlap.

The launcher is also the only place the two stacks meet. It picks one with
`--engine {legacy,v1}` or `MACE_ENGINE`, defaulting to `legacy`, and installs a
runtime guard that fails if a v1 module imports the frozen legacy package.

**`mace-launcher` is never published either, and unlike `mace-torch-v1` it does
not survive under another name.** It exists to choose between two engines, so it
has nothing left to do once the legacy package is deleted. RET-6 removes the
package and moves its `[project.scripts]` table into `mace-torch`, pointed at
`mace_torch.cli.*`. Single ownership survives that move: exactly one installed
distribution still declares each `mace_*` script, and from then on it is
`mace-torch`. The v1.0.0 release therefore publishes three distributions, not
four.

## Installing alongside the legacy package

Both stacks in one environment, from a fresh venv at the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv-v1 && source .venv-v1/bin/activate
pip install -e packages/mace-core -e packages/mace-torch \
            -e packages/mace-jax -e packages/mace-launcher
pip install -e .
```

One `pip install` for the packages, not one each: `mace-torch-v1` and
`mace-jax` require `mace-core`, which is not on PyPI, so pip has to see it as a
local requirement in the same resolution.

Then, in one process:

```bash
python -c "import mace, mace_core, mace_torch, mace_jax; print('coexist ok')"
```

The legacy install is the same `pip install -e .` it has always been. Nothing
about it changes, and the scaffold cannot enter the legacy wheel: its build
discovers packages with `setuptools.find_packages()`, which prunes any path
component that is not a Python identifier, and every directory here is
hyphenated. `tests/architecture/test_packaging_isolation.py` asserts that
rather than trusting it.

## Test file names

Test files are collected from several packages in one pytest run, under one
rootdir, and none of the `tests/` directories is an importable package. Two
files sharing a basename therefore collide on import. Prefix each test module
with its package: `test_mace_core_scaffold.py`, not `test_scaffold.py`.

## Dependencies

`mace-core` depends on numpy, ase, pydantic, pyyaml, tomli, matscipy and
safetensors, and on no array framework. `mace-torch-v1` adds torch and scipy,
with `wandb` as its one extra. `mace-jax` requires only `mace-core` until its
inference code lands. `mace-launcher` has no dependency of its own; it runs
whichever engine is installed.

## Navigating the tree

What is in each directory, where to start reading, and one line for every
source file. The file tables are checked against the tree by
`tests/architecture/test_packages_readme.py`: a source file that is added,
moved or deleted without its row fails there, so the guide cannot go stale.

### Where to start

**A training run**, in the order it happens:
`mace_torch/cli/run_train.py` parses the command line into
`mace_core/config/resolved.py`; `mace_torch/train/data_stage.py` reads the data
and resolves the E0s and statistics; `mace_torch/train/model_stage.py` builds
the model; `mace_torch/train/loop.py` trains it and
`mace_torch/train/checkpoint.py` writes it down.

**A forward pass**, from graph to forces: `mace_torch/data/graphs.py` builds
the graph `mace_core/graph.py` declares; `mace_torch/physics/outputs.py` wraps
the model, applies the strain and takes the derivatives;
`mace_torch/models/base.py` runs `mace_torch/nn/backbone.py` and then
`mace_torch/models/outputs.py`, which returns `mace_core/outputs.py`'s typed
output.

**A new kernel backend** implements `mace_core/kernels/protocol.py`, reads its
ops from `mace_core/kernels/descriptors.py` and registers an entry point; the
reference in `mace_torch/backends/reference/backend.py` is the one to copy.
**A new long-range solver** does the same against
`mace_core/electrostatics/capabilities.py` and `mace_torch/electrostatics/solver.py`.

| File | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `mace_jax/__init__.py` | The package version; inference code arrives with its tickets. |

### Tests

Each package's `tests/` directory tests that package alone; `mace-core`'s run
with no torch installed. Three directories at the repository root test across
packages: `tests/architecture` holds the fitness functions (import direction,
packaging isolation, legacy-flag coverage, this guide), `tests/parity`
compares v1 with the frozen legacy model in one process, and `tests/golden`
holds the committed reference values both stacks are measured against.
