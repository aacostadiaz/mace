"""Which structures a run trains on, and per head where its E0s come from.

A head is a level of theory, so everything that differs between two of them is
a field of :class:`HeadDataConfig` rather than a parallel list somewhere:
legacy keeps the heads in one dict and their E0s, files and weights in flags
that apply to all of them at once, which is why a multi-head run has to be
written as a YAML document the flags cannot express.

**The ten label keys are not fields here.** They are the data contract every
labelled dataset on disk was written against, so they belong to the key
convention rather than to a run. The three that *are* fields are the
graph-level inputs: an electronic temperature or a total charge is something a
particular dataset carries under a particular name, and declaring it is what
makes it readable at all. That split is the disposition table's, not this
module's.

    A replay set is large, and training on all of it would make the fine-tune
    about the replay set. So a head can keep a subset, chosen either at random
    or by farthest-point sampling over a foundation model's descriptors, after
    a filter on which elements the structures contain.

    The defaults are the frozen tree's **in-run** ones, which are not its
    standalone selection script's: ``--subselect_pt`` defaults to ``random``
    and ``--filter_type_pt`` to ``none`` (``mace/tools/arg_parser.py:603-613``),
    while the script defaults to farthest-point sampling and ``combinations``.
    The library function carries the script's.

    Args:
        num_samples: How many structures to keep. ``None`` keeps every one
            that passes the filter.

        filtering: Which structures may be kept at all, by the elements in
            them: ``none``; ``combinations``, only elements of the set;
            ``exclusive``, exactly the set; ``inclusive``, at least the set.
        elements: The atomic numbers the filter reads. Required by every
            filter but ``none``.
        allow_random_padding: When fewer structures pass the filter than
            ``num_samples``, make up the rest at random from those that did
