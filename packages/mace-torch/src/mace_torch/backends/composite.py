"""An accelerated backend with the reference behind it, op by op.

A model is built against one backend name. When that backend is an
accelerated one, it rarely builds every op the model asks for: oeq builds only
the convolution, and cueq declines the shapes its kernels get wrong. Each op
the chosen backend does not build is built by the reference instead, decided
here, once, at build time, from the backend's own answer to
``supports(descriptor)``. Nothing is tried and caught: the frozen tree's
convert, fail and reconvert (``mace/calculators/mace_torchsim.py:123-137``) has
no counterpart.

The whole chain of ops runs in one feature layout, decided here once: the
chosen backend's native layout when the reference can follow it, which it
always can, and the canonical one otherwise. Every descriptor built through the
pair is stamped with it, so an op the chosen backend declines is built by the
reference in the same layout, a fallback puts no permute between two ops, and
there is no seam to count. The model is handed the layout as :attr:`layout`
and never branches on it.

What was built where is recorded in :attr:`CompositeBackend.decisions` and
summarised by :meth:`CompositeBackend.report`, which the model stage logs. An
op the chosen backend declined is logged as a warning when it is decided, so
that a run on an accelerated backend that computes most of its layers on the
reference says so.
