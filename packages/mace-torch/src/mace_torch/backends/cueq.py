"""The cuEquivariance backend: NVIDIA's kernels behind the kernel protocol.

It builds the four ops that have a cuEquivariance kernel: the linear map, the
fused convolution, the symmetric contraction and the skip connection. Every
other op, and every shape declined here, is built by the reference through
:class:`~mace_torch.backends.composite.CompositeBackend`.

**The layout is the chain's.** Each op is built in the descriptor's layout,
which is ``ir_mul``, cuEquivariance's native one, whenever cueq is the chosen
backend: the composite resolves the chain to it and the reference follows.
Built in ``mul_ir`` instead, its ops transpose inside themselves; measured on an
A100 at 1728 atoms and 128 channels, forward and backward in float64, the
linear map takes 3.27 ms in ``mul_ir`` and 1.22 in ``ir_mul``. In ``ir_mul``
the linear map and the skip use cuEquivariance's ``naive`` method, which is
what the frozen tree uses and what measured fastest there: the skip 1.91 ms
against 3.12 with the default method, in float64.

**The weights are the canonical ones, mapped once.** Each op holds its
weights in cuEquivariance's own order and maps them to and from the canonical
form only at the checkpoint boundary:

* the linear map and the skip hold the frozen tree's ``e3nn`` order, one block
  per coupled pair of terms laid out ``[mul_in, (scalars,) mul_out]``, without
  the normalization the canonical form folds in. The map is a permutation and
  a per-weight scale;
* the convolution has no weights of its own. Its paths are in the pinned order
  and normalized alike, so the radial weights pass through unchanged;
* the symmetric contraction holds ``[Z, A, mul]`` over cuEquivariance's own
  reduced basis. The two bases span the same space and enumerate it
  differently, so the map is an ``A x A`` matrix applied per element and
  channel. It is derived once per basis shape by evaluating both bases on the
  same inputs, and cached. Measured, it is block diagonal with blocks of size
  one and two, and exact to rounding.

A fresh draw is the reference's draw, loaded through the canonical form, so a
seed builds the same model on either backend.

**What it declines.** A biased linear map (cuEquivariance's has no bias), a
convolution or contraction whose terms do not all have one copy per channel
(its kernels need a uniform multiplicity), a skip whose second input is not a
single block of scalars, and a contraction over the full basis.

With its compiled operations, cuEquivariance runs on CUDA only: some of them,
such as the layout transpose its convolution applies to its own output, have
no CPU kernel. Without them it runs its pure-torch path, correct and slow, on
the CPU. Neither is hidden: the capabilities list the one device that works,
and the backend says so when it is built. Without cuEquivariance at all,
importing this module fails, which is what the registry records.
