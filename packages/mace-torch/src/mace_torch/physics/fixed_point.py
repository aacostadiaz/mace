"""Relaxing a declared input to a fixed point, around the engine.

Some models do not evaluate once. A magnetic model relaxes the moments until
the derivative against them vanishes, and only then reports the energy. That
loop wraps the **engine**, not the model: each iteration is an ordinary
evaluation plus the derivative against the relaxed variable, which the engine
already produces by name for any declared differentiable input.

Three clauses here are the contract rather than the implementation, and each
replaces something the frozen tree does in a way that is hard to see.

**It does not differentiate through its own iterations.** The converged
variable is detached before the final evaluation, so what is reported comes
from one evaluation at the fixed point. A gradient taken through the trajectory
would be a gradient of the solver, not of the physics, and would cost memory
proportional to the step count.

**The warm start is explicit.** The frozen tree caches the converged value by
writing an attribute onto the model inside its forward, so two calls with the
same inputs return different numbers depending on what ran before, with nothing
in the signature to say so. Here it is off unless asked for, it lives on the
driver, and it has a reset.

**A second derivative through the fixed point is refused.** The chain the
converged variable would contribute is exactly the one that was detached, so a
second derivative computed anyway is not wrong by a little: it silently omits
the term the fixed point contributes. The frozen tree refuses hessians for
these models, and this refuses them by name.
