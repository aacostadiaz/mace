"""One head per declared observable.

The frozen tree has ten readout blocks and three model classes that exist only
to select among them. Six of the ten are reachable by name; the dipole pair and
the latent-charge pair are chosen by the owning model class instead, which is
the coupling this replaces. Here a head is built from an
:class:`~mace_core.observables.ObservableSpec`: the declaration says the irreps
and whether the value is per atom, and that is enough to build the readout.

A head reads the node features of every layer, not only the last. That is the
frozen tree's behaviour and it is not incidental: the site energy is a sum of
per-layer contributions, so a readout that saw only the final layer would be a
different model.
