"""The whole model in one piece: descriptor, repulsion, observables.

A graph goes in and the typed output comes out. Still no gradient call
anywhere: forces and stress are taken around this by the derivative engine.

It exists because three things have to meet somewhere. The backbone produces
node features, the short-range repulsion produces a per-atom energy that has
nothing to do with them, and the output layer needs both. Wiring that at every
call site is how a model ends up with the repulsion added in two different
places, which is exactly the difference between the two model classes the
frozen tree has.

This is also the class a new model subclasses. The backbone is not, and the
reason is forced: a model like ``PolarMACE`` adds an energy, and an energy does
not exist until the output layer has run. What the backbone produces is node
features and nothing else.

            setting rather than from either of them, and defaulting it where a
