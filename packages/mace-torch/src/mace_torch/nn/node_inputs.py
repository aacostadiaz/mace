"""Declared per-node inputs, mixed into the node features.

A magnetic moment is a ``1o`` node input. A model that uses one does not get a
new block: it declares the input, and the same equivariant map that would
handle any other declared stream brings it in. Nothing here knows what a
magnetic moment is, and the word does not appear.

The mixing is a sum onto the node features rather than a concatenation, so the
feature declaration does not change with how many streams were declared. It is
equivariant because the map into the feature space is: a ``1o`` input reaches
the ``1o`` channels and cannot reach the scalars.
