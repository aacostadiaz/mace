"""Reading and writing a model, without pickle and without a state dict.

A checkpoint is two files side by side: the tensors in safetensors, and a JSON
sidecar naming what they are. Both are the point.

**No pickle.** A legacy checkpoint is a pickled module, which is why the frozen
tree has to disable PyTorch's own safety flag to load one. Reading one means
executing whatever it contains, so a model file is code. Here the tensors are a
format a reader can validate and the sidecar is data, so a checkpoint from a
stranger is a file rather than a program.

**No state dict either.** A ``state_dict`` is a picture of one backend's module
tree: rename a submodule and it stops loading, swap the backend and it never
did. What is written instead is each operator's **canonical** form, which the
backend defines and every backend agrees on, so a model trained with one set of
kernels loads into another.

The sidecar's ``config`` is opaque here on purpose. What this module owns is
the format: the versioning, the tensor naming and the dispatch to each
operator's own loader. What the configuration means belongs to the schema that
defines it, and a format that also knew the schema would have to change
whenever the schema did.
