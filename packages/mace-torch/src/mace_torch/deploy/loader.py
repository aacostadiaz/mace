"""A trained v1 model, rebuilt from its checkpoint for evaluation.

One loader for every consumer that evaluates a model outside training: the ASE
calculator, the foundation model a fine-tune starts from, and whatever reads a
model next. A checkpoint is the canonical weights and a JSON record; the record
carries the resolved configuration and the isolated-atom energies per head, and
those two say everything a rebuild needs. The tensors then put back every
weight and every constant, so the model is built with placeholders and loaded.

The model is self-contained: its isolated-atom energies are inside it, so a
consumer never adds them back.
