"""Training, from a command line.

The whole of it: read a configuration, run three stages, write what came out.
The frozen tree's equivalent is one function of about 1,150 lines that reads 74
attributes off an argparse namespace and assigns back to it at 43 sites, so
that what a run does depends on the order the assignments happen in.

Nothing is decided here. A default belongs to the schema, a refusal belongs to
the stage that can explain it, and this module is what connects them, which is
why it is short enough to read in one go.

The surface is the configuration file plus dotted overrides. The faithful port
of the legacy flags is its own work, and the shim that maps a legacy namespace
onto this configuration already exists beside the schema; what is here is the
native one.
