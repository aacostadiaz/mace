"""The first stage: a configuration in, a bundle of resolved data out.

What this stage owns is everything that has to be decided before a model can be
built and must not be decided twice: which elements exist, what each head's
isolated-atom energies are, and what the dataset's scale is. The frozen tree
interleaves all three with the model build in one scope, and the consequence is
not untidiness: a statistic is taken against one set of E0s and the model's
buffer is filled from another, and nothing reports it.

Every fallback here is a refusal. An element with no resolvable E0, a head
whose file carries none of the declared properties, a dataset too small to
split: each of them is a run that would otherwise finish and report a number.
