"""A fine-tune, end to end: foundation, replay head, new head, training.

The fine-tuning contract the frozen tree pins, in this stack's syntax: start
from a foundation model, keep a replay head beside a new one, train, and end
with a model holding both whose error on the new data went down. The foundation
is trained here on waters and methanes; the new data is waters labelled at a
different level of theory, shifted and scaled, which is what a new head exists
to absorb. The replay head reads the foundation's own training file, since the
published datasets need the network.
